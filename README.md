This project was part of my learning journey in web development.
It allowed me to practice front-end integration, responsive design, and structured web interfaces using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap.

The goal was to reproduce a static mock-up of a construction companyâ€™s dashboard using two approaches:

- HTML5 / CSS3

- Bootstrap Framework

The interface simulates an employer account dashboard for a construction company, displaying company details, recent operations, urgent tasks, and messaging access.
An animation and a registration form were also implemented.
